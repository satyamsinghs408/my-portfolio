## Project Origin & Ownership

This project was inspired by an open-source repository that I explored to
understand the overall problem domain and workflow.

The original repository was used only as a **conceptual reference**.
I independently rebuilt the project from scratch with my own implementation.

### Major changes and contributions include:
- Migrated the project from **React to Next.js**
- Redesigned the **entire frontend UI/UX** using my own design system
- Re-architected the application structure and routing
- Implemented custom components, layouts, and state handling
- Added new features and optimizations not present in the original project

All current code, architecture decisions, and design choices in this repository
are **my own work**, created as part of my learning and development process.
